# Alien-Invasion-Game
A popular arcade game created using Python and PyGame

The player has a ship which is placed at the bottom of the screen. The player can use the arrow keys to move the ship left and right. A fleet of aliens appears at the top of the screen when the game begins. The player can use the spacebar to shoot bullets to destroy the aliens .
The score and level are displayed on the right side of the screen. The high-score is displayed at the centre and the number of ships remaining is displayed on the left side. When all the aliens on the screen are destroyed, the player advances to the next level and a new fleet appears that is faster than the previous fleet. 
If an alien hits the ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If they lose three ships, the game ends.<br><br>
